Jesse Jones
CS 442 Final Project

- Run by double-clicking one of the existing python web servers.
 
- If you have Python installed and one of the three given browsers
  you should be good.

- NOTE: It seems to run the best on serverChrome.py but 
 it was built using serverFirefox.py so it might seem a little
 fast when run using serverChrome.py
